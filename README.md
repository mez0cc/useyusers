# useyusers
Python script for generating usernames/email addresses out of a list of first/second names. Typically, first/second name lists can be grabbed with theharvester or something of the like.

The script attempts to tidy up the file before it starts working, but it is only v0.1 so it won't be so smart. By keeping the names file cleaner, you have better chances of this working properly.

### So far, these are the variations in usernames that are possible:

Output options:
1	john.doe
2	j.doe
3	johndoe
4	jdoe
5	doe.john
6	doe.j
7	doejohn
8	djohn
